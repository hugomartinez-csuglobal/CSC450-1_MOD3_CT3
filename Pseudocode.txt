BEGIN Program

    Declare integer variables:
        num1, num2, num3

    Prompt user to enter first integer
    Read value into num1

    Prompt user to enter second integer
    Read value into num2

    Prompt user to enter third integer
    Read value into num3

    Declare integer pointers:
        ptr1, ptr2, ptr3

    Allocate dynamic memory for each pointer:
        ptr1 = new integer
        ptr2 = new integer
        ptr3 = new integer

    Store values from variables into dynamic memory:
        *ptr1 = num1
        *ptr2 = num2
        *ptr3 = num3

    Display for each number:
        Value of variable (numX)
        Address of variable (&numX)
        Address stored in pointer (ptrX)
        Value stored at pointer (*ptrX)

    Deallocate dynamic memory:
        delete ptr1
        delete ptr2
        delete ptr3

    Set pointers to nullptr
